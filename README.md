# Xamarin GTK#

I want to document the minimal app setup necessary to get Xamarin working on Linux and Windows. The process was surprisingly cheeky, so my hope is to help others by sharing my work here.

## Building on Linux

Coming soon...

## Building on Windows

1. Install [Visual Studio 2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community)
2. Install [GTK# for .NET](https://www.mono-project.com/docs/gui/gtksharp/installer-for-net-framework)
3. Set `xamarin.ui.gtk` as the start-up project
4. Run the program
